Dear Sir
I am an Graduate Electronic engineer with around 07 year experience in maintenance field, currently working with a reputed concern. I am crazy about the IT and desperately want to switch over in software field. I did Visual Basic and MSAccess 1.5 year back, but I could not do any project. But I am confident that if given, I can successfully execute any project. These days I am inclined towards the web development. Kindly guide me what should I do to achieve my goal of entering in IT industry? How is the scope of internet programming and what are job opportunities in this line? Would I be able to get in as an fresher and what would be starting salary, if I enter in IT industry now?
Hello Sir, I am graduate and I want to make my CAREER in Share Market i.e. Terminal Operator through Broker of National Stock Exchange. So, suggest me the what can it do?
I am in 12 std. My problem is that I am very weak in studies. Firstly I had to take maths because my parents wanted me to. I could not handle the subject properly and the result was that I failed miserably with marks which I wont even like to describe. My condition has become so bad that I was "pushed" to XII std. I was not like that till X. I obtained 70% in X boards. now again this is my board class and I want to give my best. I have joined coaching classes unlike last year. Simantaneously I have to prepare for PET for engg. admission. My problem is that however hard I try I am not able to show that I can also get good marks, like I had my physics test recently, I tried to give my best. Read the theory at leats 3 times, took self tests, made short notes everything. But it didn't do any good. Please tell me how should I study what should be my strategy so that I can obtain good marks and obtain the lost reputation of a good student and get selected in PET with a good rank and do very well in boards. please help me!
